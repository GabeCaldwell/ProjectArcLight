# ProjectArclight

Project Arclight is a cataloging software intended for backyard astronomers. This project allows a user to store, sort, 
and manipulate many different celestial bodies, all while allowing them to be sorted, searched through and saved. This 
makes cataloging stars much easier than writing them down and flipping through a notebook. Arclight has two main funcions
managing, and journaling. The manager is intended to allow a user to work with their data. It is stored in a table that 
can be sorted and edited by the user. The journal function acts as an actual journal, this allows the user to save any 
notes or interesting events that may have occured during observation. In this way, you have the added benefit of keeping 
a database of celestial bodies while still maintaining the functionality of the notebook.
